# Creative Hero Section with Preloader

This project showcases a creative hero section with a preloader animation, responsive navigation, and smooth GSAP animations. Below are the details:

---

## **Features**

1. **Preloader Animation**:
   - The word "PHASE" animates letter by letter.
   - The "Loading..." text fades in after the letters animate.
   - The preloader fades out, revealing the main content.

2. **Responsive Navbar**:
   - Hamburger menu works on smaller screens.
   - Menu items animate when the menu is toggled.

3. **Hero Section**:
   - The text lines animate one by one with a stagger effect.

4. **GSAP Integration**:
   - All animations are powered by GSAP for smooth transitions.

## **Usage**

1. Save the code as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open it in any modern browser.
3. The preloader will animate, followed by the main content.

## **Live Environment Debugging**

If the animations don't work in your live environment:

1. **Check the Browser Console**:
   - Look for errors related to GSAP or missing resources.

2. **Ensure GSAP is Loaded**:
   - Verify that the GSAP script is correctly linked:
     ```html
     <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/3.12.5/gsap.min.js"></script>
     ```

3. **Test in Isolation**:
   - Deploy only this file to your live server to check for conflicts with other scripts or frameworks.

## **How to Use This File**

1. Save the code as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open it in any modern browser.
3. The preloader will animate, followed by the main content.
